\title{Normalize gene beta scores}
\usage{
NormalizeBeta(beta, samples = c("Control", "Treatment"),
  method = "cell_cycle", posControl = NULL, minus = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{data frame, which has columns of 'Gene', and \code{samples}.}

\item{samples}{character vector, specifying the samples in \code{beta} to be normalized.}

\item{method}{character, one of 'cell_cycle'(default) and 'loess'.}

\item{posControl}{a file path or a character vector, specifying positive control genes used
for cell cycle normalization.}

\item{minus}{numeric, scale for cell cycle normalization. Between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with same format as input data \code{beta}.
}
\description{
Two normalization methods are available. \code{cell_cycle} method normalizes gene beta scores
 based on positive control genes in CRISPR screening. \code{loess} method normalizes gene
 beta scores using loess.
}
\details{
In CRISPR screens, cells treated with different conditions (e.g., with or without
drug) may have different proliferation rates. So we defined a list of core essential genes,
which is equally negatively selected between samples with different proliferation rate.
Normalization of gene beta scores is performed using these essential genes. \code{cell_cycle}
in MAGeCKFlute normalizes the beta scores of all genes based on the median beta score of essential genes.
After normalization, the beta scores are comparable across samples. \code{loess} is another
optional normalization method, which is used to normalize array data before.

\note{
See the vignette for an example of NormalizeBeta.
Note that the source code of \code{NormalizeBeta} is very simple.
The source can be found by typing \code{MAGeCKFlute:::NormalizeBeta}
or \code{getMethod("NormalizeBeta")}, or
browsed on github at \url{https://github.com/WubingZhang/MAGeCKFlute/tree/master/R/NormalizeBeta.R}
Users should find it easy to customize this function.

data(MLE_Data)
# Read beta score from gene summary table in MAGeCK MLE results
dd = ReadBeta(MLE_Data, ctrlName = "D7_R1", treatName = "PLX7_R1", organism="hsa")
#Cell Cycle normalization
dd_essential = NormalizeBeta(dd, method="cell_cycle")
head(dd_essential)

#Optional loess normalization
dd_loess = NormalizeBeta(dd, method="loess")
head(dd_loess)
