Description: MAGeCKFlute is designed for analyzing CRISPR screenings.
    It takes gene summary file returned by MAGeCK, as input, and surports quality control,
    normalization, and screen hit identification in the CRISPR screen.
    Furthermore, for identified hits, customized functional enrichment analysis will be
    done on biological pathways, protein complex and other molecular customized signatures.
